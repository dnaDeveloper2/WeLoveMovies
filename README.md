#Overview
You've been hired as a backend developer at a new startup called WeLoveMovies.

Install and use common middleware packages

Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist

Build an API following RESTful design principles

Create and customize a knexfile.js file

Create a connection to your database with Knex

Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server

Return joined and nested data with Knex
